# Project Description
Build a convolutional neural network that can identify bird species using only images.  

## Data Source
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species)

Data set of 525 bird species. 84,635 training images, 2625 test images (5 images per species) and 2625 validation images (5 images per species).  

For this project, only 15 bird species of the 525 were used in order to reduce trianing times and to serve as a simpler introduction into neural networks.
